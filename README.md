## 🚀 What is KernelWhale?

**KernelWhale** is an Electron-based wrapper for DeepSeek Chat designed for power users. It doesn't just display code—it runs it. 

Whether you're a **Pentester** needing a quick reverse shell, a **SysAdmin** automating log rotation, or just a user wanting to organize their Downloads folder, KernelWhale bridges the gap between AI generation and local execution.

## ✨ Features

- **⚡ Instant Execution**: Adds a **"▶ Run"** button to every code block in DeepSeek.
- **� No API Key Required**: Works directly with your DeepSeek web account—no tokens needed.
- **�🖥️ Native Terminals**: Spawns real, independent terminal windows for each execution.
- **🔄 Session Management**: Handle multiple shell sessions simultaneously (great for multitasking).
- **📏 Custom UI**: Enhanced chat input with a custom **blue drag-handle** to resize your workspace exactly how you want it.
- **🔒 Local Context**: Execute commands directly on your host machine (Linux/Kali).

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository

2. **Review**: Check the code block generated by the AI.
3. **Click Run**: Hit the **▶ Run** button injected into the code block.
4. **Execute**: A terminal window opens and runs your command instantly.
5. **Resize**: Drag the **blue line** above the chat input to expand your typing area.
