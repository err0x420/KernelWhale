## 🚀 What is KernelWhale?

**KernelWhale** is an Electron-based wrapper for DeepSeek Chat designed for power users. It doesn't just display code—it runs it. 

Whether you're a **Pentester** needing a quick reverse shell, a **SysAdmin** automating log rotation, or just a user wanting to organize their Downloads folder, KernelWhale bridges the gap between AI generation and local execution.

1. **Ask DeepSeek**: "Show me how to list all open ports" or "Sort my Downloads folder by date".
2. **Review**: Check the code block generated by the AI.
3. **Click Run**: Hit the **▶ Run** button injected into the code block.
4. **Execute**: A terminal window opens and runs your command instantly.
5. **Resize**: Drag the **blue line** above the chat input to expand your typing area.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**KernelWhale executes code on your local machine.** Always review the code generated by the AI before clicking "Run". Use responsibly and only on systems you own or have permission to test.
