## 🚀 What is KernelWhale?

**KernelWhale** is an Electron-based wrapper for DeepSeek Chat designed for power users. It doesn't just display code—it runs it. 

KernelWhale bridges the gap between AI generation and local execution. Accomplish complex tasks in just a few clicks, with the ability to consult the AI for doubts and adjustments on the fly.

- **SysAdmin**: Need help **deploying Docker and configuring system services**? or automating log rotation? Do it all without leaving the chat.
- **Pentester**: Launch a reverse shell or run analysis scripts instantly.
- **User**: Organize your Downloads folder or manage your system files.

3. **Click Run**: Hit the **▶ Run** button injected into the code block.
4. **Execute**: A terminal window opens and runs your command instantly.
